**Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?**

> We have been developing the Inventory Manager app for Mobile2App. The purpose of this app is to manage the inventory for a warehouse. The end user of this app are warehouse workers, purchasers, and possibly customers of the warehouse.

**What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?**

> The Inventory Manager includes a login screen, registration screen, main inventory screen, and item detail screen. These screens were necessary to allow users to create accounts, login, and manage the warehouse inventory. This design was successful due it's simplicity and effectiveness.

**How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?**

> To approach this app, I took the big picture of what the end users would need and broke it down into digestable tasks to be performed. This approach is effective for the vast majority of projects. It is usually best to plan for the finish-line by taking one step at a time.

**How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?**

> I ensured that my code was functional by testing the code in tandem with development. This process was important because it allowed me to make quality code and alleviate rework. Currently, the application is not in a fully functional state, but this will eventually be remedied.

**Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?**

> As I am new to mobile application development, I had to innovate many times in order to build the functionality the Inventory Manager required. Particularly, I had to come up with ways to handle fragments by researching and experimenting until it worked. With experience, I will eventually know better ways to accomplish these tasks.

**In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?**

> I was particularly successful in implementing the login screen and user database. That funtionality works perfectly.
